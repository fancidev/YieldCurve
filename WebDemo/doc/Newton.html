<h1>Newton Solver</h1>
<hr/>
<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton's method</a> to fit a yield curve model to market rates. This page describes the implementation.

<p>Given a yield curve model, let $\vx$ be a vector of its state variables. Let the number of state variables be $p$. Fitting the model means solving this state vector according to certain constraints and objectives.

<h2>Market Rate Constraints</h2>

<p>Given a model with state vector $\vx$, let an instrument be represented by a function $\hat{y} = f(\vx)$ that takes the state vector as input and produces a <i>model rate</i> as output. Let $y$ denote the observed <i>market rate</i> for this instrument. Using Newton's method, we assume the function is linear at point $\vx$, such that 
$$
f(\vx + \Delta \vx) = f(\vx) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \vx} \Delta \vx
$$
where $\partial f / \partial \vx$ is a row gradient vector of $f$ with respect to the state vector. We require the implementation of each instrument to supply explicit first-order derivatives.

<p>Let $n$ be the number of market rates to fit to. For $1 \le i \le n$, let instrument $i$ be represented by a function $f_i(\vx)$. When we have $n$ market rates, this forms $n$ linear constraints.

<p>If the number of instruments is equal to the number of state variables, the model can be fit by an iterative approach as follows. Start from an initial guess $\vx_0 = \mathbf{0}$. Given a guess $\vx_k$, let $\hat{\vy}_k = ( f_1(\vx_k), \cdots, f_n(\vx_k) )^T$ be the vector of model rates. Let $\vy$ be the vector of market rates. Then solve the linear system
$$
\vJ_k \Delta \vx_k = \vy - \hat{\vy}_k
$$
for $\Delta \vx_k$, where $\vJ_k \triangleq (\partial f_1 / \partial \vx, \cdots, \partial f_n / \partial \vx)^T (\vx_k)$ is the Jacobian matrix of the instruments to the state vectors evaluated at $\vx_k$. Let $\vx_{k+1} = \vx_k + \Delta \vx_k$ be the refined guess. Repeat this process until the maximum error is smaller than a threshold, i.e. $||\hat{\vy}_k - \vy||_{\infty} < \epsilon$. We typically set $\epsilon$ to 0.0001 basis-point.

<h2>Model-Specific Linear Constraints</h2>

<p>If there are more state variables than the number of market rate constraints, i.e. $n < p$, we allow the model to supply its own linear constraints on the state variables. This is used for example in B-Spline fitting to impose constraints on the derivatives at end-points. 

<p>Let $m$ be the number of model-specific linear constraints. They take the form $\vP \vx = \vq$ where $\vP$ and $\vq$ each contains $m$ rows. We then have $m$ more equations for each iteration:
$$
\vP \Delta \vx_k = \vq - \vP \vx_k .
$$
Note that these model-specific linear constraints are fit exactly as long as there is at least one iteration.

<p>It is convenient to combine the market rate constraints and model-specific constraints into a single set of linear equations, $\vA_k \Delta \vx_k = \vb_k$, where
$$
\vA_k = \begin{bmatrix} \vJ_k \\ \vP \end{bmatrix}, \,
\vb_k = \begin{bmatrix} \vy - \hat{\vy}_k \\ \vq - \vP \vx_k \end{bmatrix} .
$$

<h2>Quadratic Objective</h2>

<p>If there are still more state variables than the number of market rates and model-specific linear constraints combined, i.e. $n + m \lt p$, we require the model to supply a quadratic form of the state vector to minimize. That is, the model must supply a $p$-by-$p$ nonnegative-definite matrix $\vH$, and in each iteration step we optimize
$$
\min_{\vx} \frac{1}{2} \vx^T \vH \vx 
$$
subject to $\vA_k \Delta \vx = \vb_k$. Using standard Lagrange method, we form the unconstrained problem
$$
z = \frac{1}{2} \vx^T \vH \vx + \vlambda^T ( \vA \vx - \vb ) .
$$
Setting $\partial z / \partial \vx = 0$ yields
$$
\vH \vx + \vA^T \vlambda = \vzero .
$$
Setting $\partial x / \partial \vlambda = 0$ yields
$$
\vA \vx = \vb .
$$
Combining them, we solve the system
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\vH & \vA^T \\
\vA & \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\vx \\ \vlambda
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{0} \\ \vb
\end{bmatrix}
.
$$
This is an equation of $p+n+m$ elements. 

<p>
Note that $\vH$ need not be invertible. In particular, if the model can already be fit using the market inputs and model-specific linear constraints, then simply set $\vH = \vzero$. In situations where $\vH$ is somewhat degenerate, we can simplify the problem a little by removing the equations that correspond to rows in $\vH$ where all elements are zero. This reduces the number of unknowns to solve.
